## Overview
This project presents a novel method for finding and evaluating mathematical expressions using Abstract Syntax Trees (AST). The approach is adaptable for both academic and professional applications, accurately parsing complex equations and accommodating a variety of mathematical operations. The AST model ensures a hierarchical expression structure, facilitating accurate and efficient evaluation. The project stands out by incorporating interactive graph visualization, simplifying mathematical computations for understanding and application.

## Key Features
AST-based Parsing: Accurate parsing of mathematical expressions using Abstract Syntax Trees.
Interactive Graph Visualization: Visual representation of functions for intuitive understanding.
Comprehensive Expression Handling: Accommodates a wide range of functions, variables, and mathematical operations.
Error Handling: Robust error management for missing operators, unusual tokens, and syntax problems.

## Usage
Lexical Analysis: Tokenizes input mathematical expressions, identifying numbers, operators, functions, brackets, and variables.
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST): Constructs a hierarchical AST representing the expression's structure.
Parsing Technique: Utilizes Recursive Descent Parsing for AST creation, applying grammar rules and maintaining operator precedence.
Evaluation of Expressions: Recursively evaluates AST nodes for accurate numerical and variable results.
Graph Visualization: Introduces graph plots for functions, aiding in understanding and analysis.
